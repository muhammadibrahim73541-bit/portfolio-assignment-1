# Portfolio Assignment 1 (M4): SGD Mechanics & Attention

This repository contains my submission for **Portfolio Assignment 1 (M4)** 
for the course *Applied Deep Learning & AI*.

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

The assignment consists of two parts:

### Part A: Manual Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Manual computation of forward pass, loss, gradients, and weight updates
- Uses a simple linear model and Mean Squared Error loss
- Manual calculations are verified using Python code
- Additional handwritten calculations are included as images

### Part B: Attention Contextualization
- Demonstrates limitations of static word embeddings
- Implements a simplified self-attention mechanism
- Uses 2D embeddings with Q = K = V = E
- Shows how context changes the meaning of the same word ("bat")
- Includes a shared embedding space visualization aligned with course lectures
